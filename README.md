ðŸš€ Overcoming Challenges with VNC Server Setup on Ubuntu 24.04 ðŸš€

To tackle this issue, We developed a shell script to automate the setup of x11vnc, ensuring a seamless configuration process for remote access. This script not only resolved the immediate problem but also streamlined future installations, making it easier for others facing similar challenges.
